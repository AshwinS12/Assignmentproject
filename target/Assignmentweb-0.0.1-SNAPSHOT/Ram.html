<h1 style = "color:white; ">Ram ,the Ideal Man,Incarnation of Lord Vishnu </h1>
<p style="text-align:right"> Dasharatha is the King of Ayodhya and <br>has three wives and four sons,
 Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughana.<br> Rama is the ideal and perfect son, and grows up with his brothers. <br>
 When he comes of age, he marries Sita, the princess of a nearby kingdom.<br> However, Bharata's mother is Kaikeyi,<br>
  who resents Rama being the crown prince. She calls up a debt that Dasharatha <br>owes her and asks for Rama to be exiled for fourteen years <br>and her son Bharata be made crown prince instead.<br>
The devastated Dasharatha has no choice and Rama prepares to leave for exile.<br> Sita and Lakshmana will not leave his side however and follow him into the forest.<br> While in the forest, Surphanaka, a female rakshasi (demoness) becomes enamored of Rama and<br> is wounded by Lakshmana while trying to kill Sita. She flees to her brother<br> Khara and asks him to avenge her. However, Khara and his army are defeated<br> by Rama and Lakshmana, and only one member of their entire army survives. <br>This lone soldier flees to the island kingdom of Lanka and begs Surphanaka's brother,<br> the mighty king Ravana to avenge them. Ravana has heard of Sita's beauty and he decides to abduct her.<br> Using trickery and magic, he manages to lure Rama and Lakshmana away from Sita <br>and kidnaps her, taking her away to Lanka.
Rama and Lakshmana travel far and wide searching for Sita but to no avail. <br>Finally, they come upon a band of vanaras or monkey-men who pledge to help him.<br> One of the might warriors of the vanaras, Hanuman, becomes Rama's staunch devotee.<br> The vanaras seek out traces of Sita and find she has been taken to Lanka. Hanuman flies to<br> Lanka and confirms she is imprisoned there. He contacts Sita and informs her<br> of Rama's whereabouts, promising that they will be back to rescue her.<br> Before returning to the mainland, Hanuman sets fire to the whole city of Lanka.<br>
Rama, Lakshmana and the vanar army build a<br> causeway from the tip of India to Lanka.<br> They travel to Lanka, where an epic battle follows between the armies.<br> Ravana is finally killed by Rama, and Sita is freed.<br> They return to Ayodhya, where Bharata returns the crown to Rama</p>
